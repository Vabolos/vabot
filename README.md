# vabot
First ever discord.py bot i have made


I tried to remove most of the errors and bugs :)
I will most likely be changing this bot to either JS or TS in the future


This bot has music commands ran by Lavalink, you will need to set this up locally to be able to use the commands in discord. 
I will add a useful .bat file that can run the commands to start it for you once it has been setup (will probably also need to be changed)
